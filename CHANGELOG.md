# sharesniffer Change Log

## [0.1-b.9] = 2024-09-05
### changed
- New Argument (--nmapdatadir): Users can specify their own NSE script directory using this argument. If they don't, the script will look for it in default directories.
- Directory Check: If the user provides a directory that doesnâ€™t exist, the script will notify them and exit.
- Dynamic NSE Script Path Detection: If no custom path is given, the script will try to locate it using common paths (/usr/local/share/nmap/scripts, /usr/share/nmap/scripts).
- Error Handling for Missing Directories: If the script cannot find the NSE script directory, it will exit with an error message.
